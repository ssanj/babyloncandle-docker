Welcome to my personal blog. I'm a software developer by day. I work mostly with JVM-based languages like Java and Scala. I dabble in some Haskell and functional programming during my leisure.

Within these pages you will find mostly technical articles. I've been recently trying to document any interesting ideas I may have come across as well. This is mostly for myself but if you gain something useful from it all the better. If you find that an article or idea resonates with you then please drop me a line on the social links below.

Enjoy!

Sanj
