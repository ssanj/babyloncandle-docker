Frankenbuilds; if Agile is so good, why are our products so bad? - Gabrielle Benefield

Are we building the wrong thing righter?
Agile takes a machine gun approach to product development. We need a sniper gun instead.
build outcomes over outputs
Deliver value faster
A3 thinking
Get out of the building and observe your users
Figure out what the core jobs are and make it easy and efficient for users to do them. Eg buying a book is the core job for a user on Amazon.
Gather as much data about usage you can
Where is the greatest upside
Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing.
Target must be clear and measurable
Set a direction
Options thinking
 - create multiple options. Many ways to reach your target.
 - create reversable decisions as soon as possible
 - create irreverasable decisions as late as possible

 How do you know what the "right thing" is? You don't. Run experiments and find out.
 Get in front of your users early and often
 Ignore your mother: be fast, dirty and cheap.
 Remove the inessential so the essential can speak
 Hit the target with as few bullets as possible
 Minimal viable not maximum possible
 Achieve your goal with as few features as possible
 Find out how users are using your products through data.
 Automate the metrics analysis of your features
 If your metrics lag, your product with lag.
 Feature switches to test across as many users as possible
 Share metrics data with your whole team - not just management
 Visual feedback as to whether we are on target
 Measure everything you do. Eg in Standups measure your communication saturation
 More features = more resources (time, money, developers etc)
