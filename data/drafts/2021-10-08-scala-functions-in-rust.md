# Either vs Result

## ADT

Either[L, R]
Result<R, L> <- order changed!

All the nice combinators have been moved to Iterator:

map
filter
flatMap (and_then)
fold vs map_or_else
collect ???

# Option vs Option


## Traverse/Sequence

## Separation of data and Behaviour

## Pattern matching

## Sequencing

## Lack of for-comps


## case classes and more
