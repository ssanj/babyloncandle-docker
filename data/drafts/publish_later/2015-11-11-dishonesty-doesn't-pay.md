I have seen public announcements go out that have deliberately misleading information in it. Information that would induce customers to buy a product they might not have purchased otherwise. Is this a big deal? It's just "marketing" right? People expect you to "stretch" the truth right?

Something else I've seen a lot of is lying about the uptime of a service. Pretending to be infallible is a waste of time. Anyone who has used any [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) knows that systems go down. Amazon goes down. Github goes down. Your service will go down at some point. Lying about it to customers is unethical and stupid. Customers also know when they are being lied to and will never trust you again.

The above cases sound like the definition of fraud:

> Fraud is generally defined in the law as an intentional misrepresentation of material existing fact made by one person to another with knowledge of its falsity and for the purpose of inducing the other person to act, and upon which the other person relies with resulting injury or damage. Fraud may also be made by an omission or purposeful failure to state material facts, which nondisclosure makes other statements misleading.

It behoves any business to function ethically within the boundaries of the law.
