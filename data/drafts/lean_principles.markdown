Lean Principle

1. pull. Customer demand pulls goods or services. Minimises overproduction, inventory 
2. One piece flow. Focus on one piece at a time. Minimises work on progress.
3.  Takt - How fast you need to manufacture a product to meet customer demand.
4.  Zero defects - mistakes from previous steps must be fixed before going on.

Eliminate Waste - Do no do anything that does not bring value right now. Can you release without this feature?
Delivery as fast as possible - MVP. Simplest thing that works.
Decide late as possible - Make decisions when you have the most amount of information possible.
