One of the biggest hurdles I've come across while learning scala, are all the new functional concepts used - most of which I know nothing about! I've also found it rather to hard to find any succinct information on these concepts, except for Haskell code and mathematical equations. While these are great for those who know Haskell and/or are proficient in mathematics it may not be the easiest thing for a simple programmer (such as myself) to understand.

I believe that in order to become a good functional programmer one needs to understand basic functional concepts and how they are implemented.

In the following months I hope to investigate the following concepts:

* [Semigroup](/posts/2010-07-20-semigroup.html)
* [Functor](/posts/2011-02-16-functor.html)
* Monoid
* Applicative
* Monad
* Arrows
* Continuations
* Isomorphic
* Monomorphic
* Referential Transparency
* Functional Composition
* Higher-order Functions
* Higher Kinds
* Type Classes
