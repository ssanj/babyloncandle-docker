For most programmers, programming is usually our day job as well as our hobby. But "working" all the time dulls our intuition.

We think we get a "lot done" but in reality we might be efficiently working on something that we shouldn't work on at all.

Take time to get away from the computer. Spend time with nature. Catch up with friends or family. Do something fun! Get some exercise!

You will find that rather than hindering your "progress", it leads to insights and questions you would never have had otherwise. "Obvious" answers will pop into your head. Your brain just needs the time to find the connections between all the information you feed it on a daily basis.

Most of all it will help you balance your life.
