There is an implied contract when a [business](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/business.html) takes money from a customer. The customer gives the business money so it will provide them with either goods or services or both.

It's easy to forget what you promised your existing customers when hunting for your new customers. This is one promise every business needs to keep.
