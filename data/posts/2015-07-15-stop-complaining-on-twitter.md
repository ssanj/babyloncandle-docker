It almost seems like Twitter was built for complaining. You often see people ranting and raging about some inanity. I recently had one of those "ranty" moments and almost tweeted about.

This time I chose to do something different. I chose to disguise my rant in a (bad) joke. Safari on my iPhone was crashing. A lot. Instead of ranting, here's what I said:

 > Safari on the iPhone can't stop crashing. I'm tempted to let Google record all my conversations so that I can browse the Internet. #apple

So it's not that funny, but at least it ties together two recent events. It also made me use my brain and made me smile. :)

The next time you want to rant or complain about something on twitter, consider writing something humorous instead.
