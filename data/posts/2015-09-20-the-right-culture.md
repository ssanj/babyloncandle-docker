The problem with working at a company that doesn't have the right culture is that you spend a lot of time during work, at lunch, at home, discussing and railing against a system which is clearly broken.

You should be using that time and energy for many useful things. To innovate. To make the world a better place. To spend time with your loved ones. To recuperate. Instead you waste it all fighting the system.
