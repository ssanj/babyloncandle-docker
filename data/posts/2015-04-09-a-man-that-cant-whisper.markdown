[Danny Bhoy](http://www.dannybhoy.com) is a very funny Scottish-Indian comedian. He has toured Australia many times and I've had the pleasure of attending some of his gigs.

More recently I watched him on a Netflix special, where he said something quite profound:

<p class="quote">I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna go on a Safari with a man that can't whisper.</p>

True for Safaris and life.
