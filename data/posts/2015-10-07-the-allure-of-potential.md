I've worked at many companies over the years. Many of them had a real potential to be great. We'd say things like "Once we get more funding" or "Once we get that big customer" or "Once we fix this bug" then "things will be better". Unfortunately most times, "things" don't get better. In fact they usually get worse. There is no magic formula to know how long you should stick it out at a company. But there are [reasons](http://sanj.ink/posts/2015-05-07-reasons.html). Potential unrealised is just a false promise. A waste of time.
