Seth Godin [has some profound insights](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/07/what-is-your-art.html) when it comes to making Art.

He starts off by defining Art as:

 > Art is a human act, a generous contribution, something that might not work, and it is intended to change the recipient for the better, often causing a connection to happen.

 Then he goes on to say:

 > You can be perfect or you can make art.

 > You can keep track of what you get in return, or you can make art.

 > You can enjoy the status quo, or you can make art. 

And the concludes by giving us a choice:

 > The most difficult part might be in choosing whether you want to make art at all, and committing to what it requires of you.
