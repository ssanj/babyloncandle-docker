When you start using any new technology everything seems so easy. So straightforward. Follow these steps and all will be well, or so we think while reading the shiny new documentation.

Unfortunately reality is never that simple. There are always things that don't work as described. Bugs. Corner cases. The real world.

I believe this is where real software development comes into play. It's an improvisation where you have to roll with the punches and make hard calls to get something to work consistently. It's the band aid that keeps production running. It's crease on your otherwise perfect shirt.
