In [his post on not caring](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/06/what-happens-when-you-dont-care), James Altucher shares some keen insights.

Only say "yes" to opportunities you love:

> I say “No” to any opportunities that will take me from what I love doing.

Do what you love to have more opportunities:

> I have NEVER seen someone who ultimately couldn’t get opportunities that they wanted if they simply stopped caring and started doing the best at what they loved.

Speak less and listen more:

> I like to try and speak less than that. It builds up mental energy to speak less. And forces me to listen more when everyone else has their opinions.

Push the boundaries of what's possible:

> When I don’t care, it’s much easier to over-promise and over-deliver. That’s what makes you a magnet of opportunity.
