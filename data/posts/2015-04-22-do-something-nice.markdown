Try to do something nice for a complete stranger at least once a week. I'm not sure where I came across this idea but it's a good one. If you find it hard to do things for strangers, try this on your work colleagues, friends or family.

This practice helps you to stop focussing on yourself all the time. It enables you think about someone else at least once a week. It also makes you feel great. :)
