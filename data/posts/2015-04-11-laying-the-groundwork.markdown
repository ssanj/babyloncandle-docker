Ideas from the chapter "Laying the Groundwork for an Effective Routine" from the book [Manage Your Day-To-Day](http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2) by Mark  McGuinness.

1. To create something truly worthwhile, you need to make room for the work you consider important. This means delaying or not doing the work you consider unimportant.
2. To create something great you need:
    * Time
    * Thought
    * Craft
    * Persistence
3. Do creative work first. Do reactive work second.
4. Do your creative work when you have the most energy during the day.
5. Use triggers like using the same tools, listening to the same music or working in the same environment each day to enter your creative zone.
6. Have a very small daily TODO list. Most things can wait until tomorrow.
