Sometimes when we are developing something, we have a hazy idea of what "done" is. "It has to do this" or "It has to do that". Once we complete our work it looks like "success". But there's no way to know for sure unless we defined our success criteria before we started work. It's easy to get lost in [vanity metrics](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/vanity-metrics/).

Once you know what your real goals are, they are much easier to hit.
