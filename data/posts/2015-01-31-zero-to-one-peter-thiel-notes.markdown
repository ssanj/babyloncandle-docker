Ideas from the book [Zero to one by Peter Thiel](http://zerotoonebook.com/)

Progress
--------
1. Horizontal - Copying things that work. Going from 1 to x.  Eg. You take one typewriter and then build another hundred copies.
1. Vertical - Doing new things. Going from 0 to 1. Eg. You take a typewriter and build a word processor.

Startup Thinking
----------------
* A new company's most important strength is new thinking.
* A startup has to question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.
* A lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature but he will never create an entire industry on his own.
* Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get things done. You also need to stay small enough so you actually can.
* A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

Monopolies
----------
* Competition and Capitalism are opposites.
* Monopolies exaggerate the power of their (nonexistent) competition to avoid scrutiny.
* Entrepreneur's exaggerate how powerful they are and understate the competition. "We are in a league of our own".
* The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. You also have to discount future cash flow to its present worth due to depreciation.
* Ask yourself "will this business be around a decade from now?"


How to Build a Monopoly
-----------------------

### 1. Proprietary Technology

* A proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension.
* The easiest way to be 10 times better is to invent something new. Where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite.

### 2. Network Effects

* Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it. Eg. Twitter.
* To reap the benefits of network effects, your product must be useful to its very first users, when the network is naturally small.
* You must start will specially small markets.

### 3. Economies of Scale

* The cost of creating another copy of your software should be close to zero.
* A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.

### 4. Branding

* A technology company can't be built on brand alone.
* Begin with substance then build your brand.

How to Choose A Market
-----------------------

* Start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small.
* It's easier to dominate a small market than a large one.
* Choose a small group of particular people, concentrated together and served by few or no competition.
* It's a red flag to talk about 1% of a very large market. You'll have to fight too many competitors to get that 1%.
* Once you create and dominate a niche market, gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Eg. Amazon wanted to dominate all online retail but started with books.
* Don't disrupt. Avoid competition as much as possible
* "You must study the endgame before anything else" - Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca

The Power Law
-------------

* A small handful of companies radically outperform all others.
* The differences between companies dwarf differences in roles within companies.
* Before you focus relentlessly on something you're good at, think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.
* For startups this means you should not necessarily start your own company, even if you are extraordinarily talented. It might be better to join a successful company when it's growing fast.
* You could have 100% equity if you fully fund your own company. If it fails you will have a 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google will give you millions.


Secrets
-------
* There are two kinds of secrets:
    1. Secrets about nature - Undiscovered aspects of the physical world.
    1. Secrets about people - Things people don't know about themselves or things people want to hide from you.
* What secrets is nature not telling you?
* What secrets are people not telling you?
* You can't find secrets without looking for them.
* The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking for them.
* A great company is a conspiracy to change the world.


Selling
-------

Your company needs to sell more than its product. You must sell your company to employees and investors.

Computers are a Tool
--------------------

"How can computers help humans solve hard problems?"

Planning
-------

* Jobs saw that you can change the world through planning; not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others' success.
* Long-term planning is often undervalued in our indefinite short-term world - If you see the future as random why plan?


7 Questions Every Business must Answer
--------------------------------------

1. Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. Do you have the right team?
5. Do you have a way to create and deliver your product?
6. Will your market position be defensible 10 to 20 years into the future?
7. Have you identified a unique opportunity others don't see?


The Future
----------

* Focus on making new things.
* Make the future not just different but better.
* Think for yourself.
* Look at the world with fresh perspective similar to the ancients.
