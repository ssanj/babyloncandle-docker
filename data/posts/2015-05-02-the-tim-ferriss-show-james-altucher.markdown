Some interesting ideas from [The Tim Ferriss Show's interview with James Altucher](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/11/james-altucher):

1. You are the average of the 5 people you spend time with the most.
2. You should be grateful for abundance. Stop behaving like you are awesome and that you deserve greatness.
3. Having a routine is one way to mitigate risk.
4. Read inspiring writers before you start writing yourself.
5. Try to improve by 1% a week. This leads to enormous improvements over the course of a year.
6. It's only through failure that we can find our way to success.

7. If you loose a $100 you can easily make it back. If you loose 5 minutes you can never get that back.
8. Say no to things that you do not want to do.
9. Time is not money. Time is more valuable than money.
