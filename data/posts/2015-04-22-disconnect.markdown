People are too "connected" these days. Connected with their devices that is. The more "connected" we are with our devices, the less connected we seem to be with real people and the world around us.

Take time everyday to disconnect. Put away your mobile phone. Unplug those headphones. This practice will help you reconnect with the physical world and people around you. It will make your life a lot richer than when staring at a screen all day.
