There are reasons we choose to lead lives we don't love. Jobs we detest. Relationships that don't nourish us. Doing something about a bad situation takes a lot of courage. A lot of effort. You need to prove yourself again. Prove that you are good enough. That you are worthy. It's so much easier to complain about your life, your job, your relationships and stay where you are. It's scary to think about doing something about it. But that's exactly what you must do make a life worth living.
