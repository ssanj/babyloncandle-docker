I recently watched [Conan Oâ€™Brien in conversation with Harvard University President Drew Faust](https://youtu.be/gCVZIpxUEhg). In it he answers a question about how make a name for yourself when starting out. He lists two main rules on how to get a job in any economy:

1. Work really hard.
2. Be easy to work with.

He elaborates on point 2 with:

* Be someone people enjoy working with.
* Be helpful.
* Try to help the group (not just yourself).
* Be kind.
* Be nice.

Great words to work by. :)
