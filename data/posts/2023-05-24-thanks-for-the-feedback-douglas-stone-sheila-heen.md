Ideas from the book [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.amazon.com.au/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670922633/)

- Our need for acceptance and our need to improve are both affected by feedback. Often these are competing needs.
- Actively seeking out feedback in a work environment can lead to significant positive gains if handled properly.
- Our inherent triggers are barriers to us hearing feedback, accepting it and learning from it.
- Try to ensure that you understand feedback before accepting or rejecting it.


## Types of Feedback
| Type of Feedback | Giver's Purpose |
| ------------------| ---------------- |
| Appreciation | Thank, motivate and connect |
| Coaching | Improve capabilities and identify blind spots |
| Evaluation | Rating or decision making |

- Ensure you know which type of feedback is being given.
- Explicitly ask for the type that you are after to avoid confusion.
- If you're giving feedback check with the receiver that the feedback is being received in the type requested.
- Clarify what the feedback means without jumping into conclusions See [Additional Prompts](#additional-prompts)
- Feedback is subjective to the person giving it. It's shaped by their experiences and temperament. Ask for examples. Find out what "good" looks like in the future.
- All feedback is Data + Judgement call (based on their experience of the world) -> Label -> Future consequences (as they see it)

## How Others see your Actions

### The Gap Map

- We focus on our intentions in a situation. Others focus on the effect our actions have on them in the same situation.
- We blame the situation for our failure. Others blame our character for the failure.
- We downplay our emotions in a situation while others experience them in an amplified way.

## Blind Spots

- You can get honest feedback from someone that dislikes you or with someone you don't get along with.
- Ask the people you have the hardest time with to give you feedback.
- Discuss separate topics separately. Identify the different streams and call them out. Focus on one stream at a time.
- Each of us only sees one side of the problem.
- Each of us is involved in the problem to different degrees.
- Notice if you are reacting to the other person.
- The three issues of a relationship system:
  1. Differences - Are the difference between us causing problems?
  2. Roles - Is this a result of the roles we play?
  3. Processes - Are processes, politics, physical environment etc making the problem worse?

> when it comes to stories about yourself, you get what you Google

- Look for the good or look for the bad. You'll always find something to answer you query.

## Feedback

- How you perceive feedback is based on three things:
  - Baseline - how happy or sad are we generally
  - Swing - How far off the base line are you pushed by positive or negative events
  - Sustain and Recovery - How long are you pushed away from your baseline due to a positive or negative event?

Feedback Quadrant

    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Long Sustain of Positive</th>
    <th scope="col">Short Sustain of Positive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Quick Recovery from Negative</th>
    <td>Low risk, high reward. "I love feedback" </td>
    <td>Low risk, low reward. "No big deal either way"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Slow Recovery from Negative</th>
    <td>High risk, high reward. "I'm hopeful but fearful"</td>
    <td>High risk, low reward. "I hate feedback"</td>
  </tr>

- We can extend the positive feelings we get from positive feedback by recalling it regularly from memory.
- Feelings exaggerate feedback.
- Figure out how you typically react to feedback (do you get defensive or appreciative?)
- Check in with yourself during a feedback session to see how you are doing.
- Notice how you embellish the story.
- Things to keep in mind:
  - **Time** - The present doesn't change the past and **may** determine the future.
  - **Specificity** - Being bad at one thing does not make you bad at everything. Just because you're bad at something now, doesn't mean you'll always be bad at it.
  - **People** - Just because one person doesn't like us doesn't mean that everyone doesn't like us. People's views change over time.
- Our predictions of the future are often wrong.
- Imagine the feedback is not about you but of someone else. What advice would you give that person on how to respond?
- Ask: "How significant this feedback would be X years from now?"

> Tragedy + Time = Comedy

- See your life as an amusing play. Don't take everything so seriously.
- You can't control what other people think of you.

## Second Score

The first score is the feedback itself. The second is the score you give yourself for handling the feedback, and your subsequent improvements (if any).

## Setting Boundaries

- Set limits on feedback. You can dictate the time, frequency or say no to the way it's delivered.

> Unhelpful feedback is useless: relentless unhelpful feedback is destructive

- If the person doesn't care about the effect of feedback on you or is not listening, then there is something wrong with the dynamic.
- Let the person giving you feedback know the kind of feedback you do want.
- Use `And` instead of `But`. `And` signifies that two things are true not just one.

> I have been afraid to talk to you about this *and* it's important to me to be honest with you

- The [J curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_curve): A J curve is any of a variety of J-shaped diagrams where a curve initially falls, then steeply rises above the starting point.

> Things might get worse before they get better.

- Try on different feedback for a while (eg. A couple of weeks). If it's not working discard it.
- Make it easy for people to give you feedback. Don't demand that it be delivered in a specific way.
- Feedback should be specific doing your current job more effectively.
- Have a balanced view.

Ask:

> What's wrong with this feedback?

Then ask:

> What's right about this feedback?

- You don't always have to accept feedback.
- Encourage people to think about the feedback and their second score.
- Ask people to coach you on how to give better feedback.
