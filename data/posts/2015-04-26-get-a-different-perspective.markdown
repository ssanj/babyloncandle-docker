[Pamela Fox](https://twitter.com/pamelafox) shared this idea on Twitter a while back:

> Do something in a new way each day. Whether it's eating a different lunch or walking a different way to work or writing with your left hand. Keep doing things that give you a new perspective.

Doing something differently to the way you "always do it" has the side effect of waking up your brain. You are forced to "tune in" as opposed to "tuning out". You notice new things. You enjoy your experience more. You learn. :)
