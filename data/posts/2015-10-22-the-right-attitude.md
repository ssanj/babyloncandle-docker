People think that having the right attitude about a bad situation will help. When you've got no options, what else can you do?

By choosing to see the best in your current bad situation you start deluding yourself that things are not so bad. You start seeing the "positive" around you. Soon you don't want change because you have fooled yourself with cognitive dissonance. All the while you loose part of your soul each day. Soon you stop dreaming. You settle for the garbage that's fed to you.

Sometimes you need the wrong attitude. You need to know what you deserve and make the hard choices now so you can have a better future. Sometimes you need to take a stance and then look for options.
