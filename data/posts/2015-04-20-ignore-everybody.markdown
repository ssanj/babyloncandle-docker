Ideas from the chapter "Ignore Everybody" from the book [Ignore Everybody And 39 other Keys to Creativity](http://gapingvoid.com/ie) by Hugh MacLeod.

1. The more original your idea is, the less good advice other people will be able to give you.
2. You don't know if your idea is any good the moment it is created. Neither does anyone else.
3. A big idea will change you.
4. Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships. That is why good ideas are initially resisted.
5. Good ideas come with a heavy burden, which is why so few people execute them.
