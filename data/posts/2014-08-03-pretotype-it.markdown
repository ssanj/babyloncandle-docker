A [coworker](https://twitter.com/danofhisword) introduced me to the idea of [Pretotyping](http://www.pretotyping.org). Although Pretotyping sounds like "Prototyping" it's quite different. Pretotyping is where you test out your ideas and theories for a product or service in the cheapest and quickest way possible. As the name of one of the pretotyping book's state:

> "Building the right __it__ before you build __it__ right".

The Pretotyping manifesto brings together some simple, yet powerful ideas which encourage pretotyping and innovation in general. I found the manifesto to be a little muddled and and I found it easier to separate it into these two groups:

Preferred Ideas
===============

__Innovators__ beat ideas

__Pretotypes__ beat productypes

__Building__ beats talking

__Simplicity__ beats features

__Now__ beats later

__Commitment__ beats committees

__Data__ beats opinions


Uncommon Sense
==============

_Don't finish what you started_

_Failure is an option_

_Scarcity brings clarity_

_The more the messier_

_Reinvent the wheel_

_Play with fire_


Here are some free books to you get started:

1. [Pretotype It](http://www.pretotyping.org/uploads/1/4/0/9/14099067/pretotype_it_2nd_pretotype_edition-2.pdf)
2. [Pretotyping @ Work](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0QztbuDlKs_bHdnQ2h5dnNvcE0/edit)

Some of these ideas can help you to innovate. Others can help you think differently about what you build, whether you need to build it and if so, how to build it right.
