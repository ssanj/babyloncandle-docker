Anyone who tells you different doesn't know what they are talking about.

You might hear something like:

 > It's a simple fix. All you have to do is do X.

Things always seem simpler to people who do not understand the implications of the changes they want you to make.

Or you might hear:

 > It's conceptually simple.

 Here's something that's conceptually simple:

 > Take man from Earth and put him on the Moon.

 You just want to move a person from one place to another. What's the problem? Simple right?
