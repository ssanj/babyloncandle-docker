[Something James Altucher learned from Richard Branson](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/02/10-things-i-learn-from-richard-branson) is that:

> When people think a problem is impossible they value it at zero. Successful people buy ideas low (zero) and sell them high.

What "impossible" ideas do you have?
