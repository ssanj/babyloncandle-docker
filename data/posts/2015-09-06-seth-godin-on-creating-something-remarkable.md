Seth Godin in his [article on pulling a hat out of a rabbit](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/06/pulling-a-hat-out-of-a-rabbit.html) says that:

> It's tempting to do what's been done before, certain in the belief that if you do it, it'll be a little better and a little more popular, merely because you're the one doing it.

> In fact, though, that's unlikely. You'll care more, but it's unlikely the market will.

Consider doing it differently:

> Consider the alternative, which is choosing to turn the question upside down, to do it backwards, sideways, or in a significantly more generous or risky way.

> Remarkable often starts with the problem you set out to solve and the way you choose to solve it.
