Ideas from the chapter "Understanding our Compulsions" from the book [Manage Your Day-To-Day](http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2) with Dan Ariely.

1. In order manage your time better you need some way of measuring your progress. Big tasks that take a lot of effort over a long time can be seen as wasteful. This is because we can't sometimes measure our progress.
2. If you work on a computer you can't see all the effort of your previous work - it is lost in deletes and updates.
3. Keep a diary of your progress. Keep older versions around.
