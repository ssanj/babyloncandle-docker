Seth Godin in his article [After You've Done Your Best Work](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/08/after-youve-done-your-best-work.html) says that if your best work has been ignored then:

> You really have no choice but to do it again. To do your best work again, as impossible and unfair as that seems.

Because:

> It compounds over time.

And:

> Best work followed by best work followed by more best work is far more useful and generous than merely doing your best work once and insisting we understand you.
