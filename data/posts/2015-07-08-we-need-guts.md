Not in a zombie apocalypse-kind of way. Seth Godin in [The fruitless search for extraordinary people willing to take ordinary jobs](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/06/the-fruitless-search-for-extraordinary-people-willing-to-take-ordinary-jobs.html)  says that:

 > Building an extraordinary organization takes guts. The guts to trust the team, to treat them with respect and to go to ridiculous lengths to find, keep and nurture people who care enough to make a difference.

He also says that amazing people need to be nurtured:

 > It's unreasonable to expect that you'll develop amazing people when you don't give them room to change, grow and fail.

I couldn't agree more.
