It's easy to complain. It's easy to think your life is really hard. It isn't. It could be so much worse.

You could have cancer. You could be homeless. You could have lost one or more of your senses. You could be unemployed. You could be depressed. You could be an addict. You could live in a war zone. You could be dead. Chances are, you could be worse off in a lot of ways than you are now.

Your life is good. It's a gift. Be thankful. Enjoy it.
