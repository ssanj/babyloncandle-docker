Something I've been doing to [get a different perspective](http://sanj.ink/posts/2015-04-26-get-a-different-perspective.html) has been to visit different coffee shops during the week.

A few weeks ago I had seen an interesting coffee shop near the train station and thought I'd give it a try. This coffee shop that will go unnamed, broke one of the golden rules of running a business:

> Never deliver a sub par product in a highly competitive market.

Given the number of coffee shops per square metre in the Brisbane CBD, a coffee shop can't afford to serve bad coffee. This is coffee shop suicide. If that wasn't bad enough, I was hit with the "Five dollar minimum on fpos" statement. This was followed by the "you can pre-purchase your weekly coffee on this card" scam. Um, no thanks.

Five minutes later I dumped their crappy coffee in the bin and headed back to [my usual](https://www.facebook.com/coffeeanthology) for an awesome coffee.
