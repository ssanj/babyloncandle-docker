Another great article sent to me by my friend [Ryan](http://ryandrake.com) was this one by [Seth Godin on waiting for the one thing that will change everything](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/08/the-one-thing-that-will-change-everything.html). In it Seth talks about that one thing:

> That introduction you need.

> The capital that your organization is trying to raise.

> The breakthrough in what you're building...

And the real effect that one thing has once you get it:

> Have you noticed that as soon as you get that one thing, everything doesn't change? In fact, the only thing that changes is that you realize that you don't need that one thing as much as you thought you did.

He advises to stop waiting for a silver bullet:

> It turns out that nothing will change everything for the better. It works better to focus on each step instead of being distracted by a promised secret exit.
