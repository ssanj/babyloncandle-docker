I have a compulsion to read as many articles or to gather as much information as I can. I speed read through the current article because there are many more waiting to be read. Along the way I miss the point completely. I don't enjoy the act of reading. Neither do I contemplate deeply the content I do read. I just file anything of interest in a todo list and never look at it again. Then I'm off again, collecting information instead of seeking knowledge.

More recently I've decided to stop overindulging in information. I've decided to read a very few articles a week. I read them slowly, and thoughtfully. I try to ponder about any questions raised. I try to incorporate any good habits into my daily routine. The end result has been very enjoyable. I no longer have the need to rush to the next article or titbit of information. I am information sated.
