Are you struggling at learning something hard? Have you thought about joining or creating a support group?

Being around other beginners is a great way to learn by osmosis.

Meetup is a great place to find a group for almost anything you can think of. But your workplace, mailing lists etc are also some other places to look for groups. If you can't find a group consider starting one of your own.
