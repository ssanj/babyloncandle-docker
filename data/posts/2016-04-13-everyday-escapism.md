I recently read [Reading Fiction as Meditation](https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/reading-fiction-as-meditation-9a6bb42d9f82#.u6elxf69u). It spoke about escapism - escaping from your daily grind and giving your mind a break. It got me thinking about other things that could give you the same effect. Here's an interesting quote from the article:

> I’ve seen too much online about “how to read more quickly.” Bollocks. It’s not a competition. It’s relaxation: an act of escapism. I mean, who goes to a cinema and asks them to put the film on fast forward with subtitles so they can watch it faster?

I came up with the following list of mundane tasks that could provide you with that daily dose of escapism - if you let it. And what I mean by that is that you have to only focus on the task and cut out all other distractions like watching TV, reading Twitter, listening to a podcast etc while doing these tasks.

* Ironing your clothes
* Washing the dishes
* Cooking a meal (frozen dinners do not count as cooking!)
* Going for a walk
* Cleaning (your house, car etc)
* Sketching in a journal
* Playing an instrument
* Playing with your children
* Having a relaxing brew
* Having a cat nap

What others can you think of?
