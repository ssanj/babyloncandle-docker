Ideas from the chapter "Honing your creative practice" from the book [Manage Your Day-To-Day](http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2) with Seth Godin.

1. Lots and lots of people are creative when they feel like it, but you are only going to become a professional if you do it when you don't feel like it. And that emotional waiver is why this is your work and not your hobby.
2. Practice is a big part of being creative.
3. Being creative means you have to sell your ideas. Selling is part of it because if you don't sell it, there is no art.
4. It's much easier to whine and sabotage yourself and blame the client, the system, and the economy. This is what you hide from - the noise in your head that says you are not good enough, that says it is not perfect, that says it could have been better.
