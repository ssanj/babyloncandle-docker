In the last article, [It Takes Time to Build Something Great](2015-03-14-it-takes-time-to-build-something-great.html) we thought about the idea of spending a long period of time to create something truly great.

So where do we find time to get all this work done? The book [Manage your day-to-day](http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2) recommends routines as a way of getting into a regular rhythm of creating things. Routines train your mind to get into "creative" mode. They also help you plan your time more predictably.

Set up a weekly schedule of when you will work and for how long. This will ensure you always have time set aside to do your (great) work.
