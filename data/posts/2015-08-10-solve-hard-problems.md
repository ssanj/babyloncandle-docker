Computers are good at many things that people are not good at. Complex calculations. Laboriously detailed tasks. Multitasking. Some decisions can only be made by people - for the moment at least. As [Tim Brown said](http://sanj.ink/posts/2014-10-14-tim-brown-on-thinking-big.html) we need to make software that makes our lives easier and more enjoyable.

Now I'm not saying creating ToDo apps don't make our lives easier. But we can simply skip the app all-together and use a pen and paper. It's not really solving a problem we can't solve without a computer.

What hard problems can Computers help us solve? What can we make possible that isn't? Once we build it will it make our lives better?
