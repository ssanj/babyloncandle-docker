It's great to a have a routine. It's great to have goals. It's great to work consistently day in and day out.

Sometimes you just don't feel like you have the motivation. Your work feels like a chore. Or that you've done all you want to do for the moment. You may have lost your "flow" - where your craft just pours out of you without any provocation.

When this happens, take a break from your routine. You can never produce your best work when your heart is not in it.

Take a day, a week or even a month off. You could even build it into your routine. This time off will help you to revitalise your creative spirit and come back refreshed and renewed to do awesome work.

Don't be afraid to break your routine when you need to.
