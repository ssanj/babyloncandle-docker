the hurting starts, I mentioned to a mate at work. If you are not learning anything new then you are stagnating. There is no excuse to stagnate for eight hours a day, five days a week.

While you are learning new things you might turn a blind eye to other obvious issues with your workplace. You might trade learning for somewhat dubious work conditions and practices. Once you are no longer getting any benefit from learning new things, the issues with your workplace will become magnified and move into focus.

If you find yourself in a dead end job where you're not learning anything useful it's time for you to start looking for new opportunities.
