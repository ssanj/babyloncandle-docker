Sometimes you know what you must do. The path is clear, but it fills you with dread. You feel afraid. What if you fail? What if it's not as good? What if... What if...

Sometimes you just have to do what you know is the right thing - no matter how hard it is. Once you take a leap of faith, you'll always land... somewhere.
