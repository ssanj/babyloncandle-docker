[James Altucher in his interview with Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/11/james-altucher) states that:

 > People say time is money, time is not money. Time is much more valuable than money, an infinite times more valuable than money

We can't make time. So why do we squander time by doing things we hate? Doing things out of obligation? Doing things to keep up appearances?

Most of us work in jobs we detest. We "need the money". We end up exchanging a lot of time for money.  What if we lead simpler, cheaper lives? This would give us more time. Time to live. Time to do the things we love. Time to spend with our loved ones. Time to make a difference.

Given that everyone knows this fact at some cerebral level, why do we continue to waste our most scarce resource?
