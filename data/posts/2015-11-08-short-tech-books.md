Technical books are always so long. But recently I've come across two very short books:

1. [Effective Akka](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Akka-Jamie-Allen/dp/1449360076) by [Jamie Allen](https://twitter.com/jamie_allen) (74 pages)
1. [ScalaCheck](http://www.artima.com/shop/scalacheck) by Rickard Nilsson (137 - 148 pages depending on whether you get the ebook or print)

These books are awesome and cover one topic very well. A short book gives the reader the motivation to completely read it, instead of giving up around page 300. I hope this catches on.
